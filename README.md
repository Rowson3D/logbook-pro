# Logbook-Pro
[Placeholder product page]

## Goal
As a platform built by pilots, for pilots, this is meant to be an open-source, accessible application that will allow anyone in need of an electronic logbook application to log flight hours, produce reports, maintain airplanes, and manage maintenance logs.

# Getting started

## Cloning the repository
```git clone https://github.com/Rowson3D/logbook-pro.git```

## Installing Node.js / npm / npx

https://nodejs.org/en

Verify the versions of ```npm``` ```npx``` ```node```:

```
npm --version
```

```
npx --version
```

```
node --version
```

## Installing Vite

## Running and Debugging React

### Run Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

3. **Open Browser**: Your React app will automatically open in your default web browser.

### Debugging

- **Browser Developer Tools**: Use your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect elements, debug JavaScript, and monitor network activity.

- **React Developer Tools**: Install the React Developer Tools browser extension to debug React components, inspect component hierarchies, and track component state.


# The Future

## Objective
The objective of the following is to outline the potential opportunities and/or features that are planned to be designed into the software.

## Features
1. **Flight Logging:**
   - Ability for pilots to log details of their flights, including date, aircraft type, departure and arrival airports, flight duration, etc.
   
2. **Aircraft Management:**
   - Functionality to manage aircraft details, such as registration number, model, capacity, maintenance logs, etc.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Generate customizable reports based on logged flights, including summaries, statistics, and historical data analysis.

4. **Reminders (stretch goal):**
   - Set reminders for upcoming flights, maintenance schedules, license renewals, etc.

5. **User Authentication:**
   - Secure authentication system for pilots to access their logbook data.

6. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visual representation of flight data using charts, graphs, and maps for better analysis.

7. **Export/Import:**
   - Ability to export logbook data in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) and import data from other sources.

8. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Support for web browsers and mobile devices to access the application seamlessly.

## Technical Considerations
1. **Front-End Technologies:**
   - HTML, CSS, Typescript
   - Frameworks: React.js, Vite.js
   
2. **Back-End Technologies:**
   - Node.js
   - Database: MongoDB
   
3. **Authentication:**
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
   
4. **Database Design:**
   - Design schema for storing flight logs, aircraft details, user profiles, etc.

5. **API Design:**
   - RESTful API for communication between front end and back end.
   
6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy application to a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud Platform.
   
7. **Testing:**
   - Unit testing for individual components.
   - Integration testing for API endpoints.
   
8. **Security:**
   - Implement measures to prevent unauthorized access and protect user data.
   
9. **Scalability:**
   - Design architecture to handle increasing user load and data volume.

## Next Steps
1. **Wireframing and Mockups:**
   - Create wireframes and mockups to visualize the application's layout and user interface.
   
2. **Development Environment Setup:**
   - Install necessary development tools and set up the development environment.
   
3. **Database Implementation:**
   - Design and implement the database schema.
   
4. **Front-End Development:**
   - Start building the user interface and front-end functionality.
   
5. **Back-End Development:**
   - Implement server-side logic and APIs.
   
6. **Integration and Testing:**
   - Integrate front end with back end and perform testing.
   
7. **Deployment and Maintenance:**
   - Deploy the application and plan for regular maintenance and updates.
